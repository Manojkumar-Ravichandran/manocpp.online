                I am a Full Stack Developer with experience in Java, Spring Boot, React,
                and SQL. I transitioned from mechanical engineering into software
                development, bringing analytical thinking, process understanding, and a
                passion for building real-world applications. I enjoy solving problems,
                optimizing systems, and creating responsive user interfaces.
